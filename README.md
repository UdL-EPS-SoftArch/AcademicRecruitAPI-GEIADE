## Vision

**For** members **who** take part in the selection process of candidates and **for** candidates
**who** want to apply for teaching staff vacant posts.

**the project** AcademicRecruit **is a** platform to manage the selection process taking into account stakeholders' interests

**that** allows managing commissions, documents and commissioners in order to keep track of the selection processes of candidates

**Unlike** existing tools, AcademicRecruit fits the UdL standards.
